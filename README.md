# Hack OHI/O 2017
Front-end application for image recognition project.
Challenge: create a mobile app that service technicians can
leverage to obtain the information they need faster by scanning the nameplate and interpreting the
results. This solution should leverage the phoneâ€™s camera to complete this scanning. The fields with
which these technicians may want to retrieve on the spot are the following:
* Brand
* Catalog Number or Style Number
* Order Number (GO# or PO#)

# Compile

3) Modify `index.html` `config` variable for your Firebase Account

# Run
 Open `index.html`

 # Challenges
